# CSV-JSON Converter API

### A light weight API that accepts
- `.csv` files
- `.json` files
- URLs to `.csv` or `.json` files
### and returns their converted formats in a `.zip` archive. 

## Motivation 
I've been eager to learn Go for some time, and this seemed like a suitable first project to tackle while familiarizing myself with some of the basics.
